"""
This module provides a DeleteService class that allows for the deletion of files
uploaded to a Discord server.
The class uses a HybridDBhandler object to keep track of file metadata and the Discord API
to delete the associated
channels. The main function of the class is the `main` method, which takes in a file selection
string and attempts to
find the associated channel ID. If a channel is found, the `delete_file` method is called
to delete the channel and
remove its metadata from the database. If a channel is not found, an error message is displayed.

Classes:
    DeleteService: Provides functionality for deleting files uploaded to a Discord server.
